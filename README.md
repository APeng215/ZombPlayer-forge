This is a forge mod for Minecraft which spawns a zombified player when a player is killed by zombified creature.

## Features

- When a player is killed by zombified creature (including husks, drowneds etc.), a zombie will be spawned in the place.
- The zombie will inherit player's equipment and inventory. Players need to kill the zombie to retrieve them. _This feature won't work when the gamerule `keepInventory` is set to true._
- The head of the zombie is same as the player's, and will drop if killed by a __charged creeper__.
- The zombie will convert to the drowned when drowned like normal zombies.
- The zombie won't burn in sunlight.
- Type command `/gamerule doPlayerInfected [false/true]` to switch the mod. (Default true)
